    <string name="textview3">Hi there, A mealybug that causes severe infestations of papaya and other hosts by feeding on fruits and stems, resulting in yellowing, stunting, deformed leaves, and fruit drop. Fruit becomes covered in crusts of mealybugs and waxy secretions, and the latter are common on leaves and stems, too. As the mealybug feeds on sap it expels liquid which falls onto leaves and attracts growth of dark fungi which prevent the leaves functioning normally.</string>
